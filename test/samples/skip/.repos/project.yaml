  Testing project for repos.
  This project tests skipping logic. To test:
  repos b repos.test.skip:next  - it should build everything
  repos b repos.test:skip:next  - it should skip everything
  repos b -f repos.test.skip:original - it should build original
  repos b repos.test.skip:next  - it should skip original but build next.
targets:
  original:
    rule:
      exec:
        command: >
          echo 'Original' >"$REPOS_OUTPUT_DIR/result.txt"
        out: result.txt

  next:
    deps:
    - original
    rule:
      exec:
        command: >
          echo 'Next' >"$REPOS_OUTPUT_DIR/next.txt"
        out: next.txt
